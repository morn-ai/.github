# Morn AI

**Morn** is an out-of-the-box project for building and integrating intelligent agents. It helps developers go from **zero to working agent** - fast.

> **Why named "Morn"?**  
> “Morn” symbolizes a new beginning — just like morning marks the start of a new day, Morn AI helps developers quickly awaken and launch intelligent agents.  
> The name is short, memorable, and aligns with the idea of awakening intelligence.
